## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require attargah/anti-scam
```

### Publish Configuration, Migrations and Translations

```bash

php artisan vendor:publish --tag="anti-scam-migrations"

php artisan vendor:publish --tag="anti-scam-translations"
```

php artisan migrate
```

### Configure the Package

Set your secret key in the `config/anti-scam.php` file:

```php
'key' => env('ANTI_SCAM_KEY', 'your-secret-key-here'),
```

## Configuration

The package provides extensive configuration options in `config/anti-scam.php`:

### Anti-Scam Configuration

```php
'scam' => [
    'active' => true,                    // Enable/disable scam protection
    'ban' => false,                      // Permanently ban scam IPs (not recommended)
    'save_log' => true,                  // Save scam attempts to database
    'register_logs_to_panel' => true,    // Show logs in admin panel
    'order_random' => true,              // Randomize input field order
    'display' => [
        'active' => false,               // Hide fields with CSS
        'css' => 'display:none!important',
    ],
    'off_screen' => [
        'active' => true,                // Move fields off-screen
        'css' => 'position:absolute!important; left:-9999px!important; z-index:-9999!important;',
    ],
],
```

### Anti-Spam Configuration

```php
'spam' => [
    'active' => true,                    // Enable/disable spam protection
    'max_requests_per_window' => 5,      // Max requests per time window
    'window_in_seconds' => 60,           // Time window length
    'ban_duration_multiplier' => 3,      // Progressive ban duration multiplier
    'permanent_ban_threshold_min' => 10080, // Permanent ban threshold (7 days)
],
```

## Usage

### 1. Protect Your Forms

Use the `@protect` Blade directive in your forms:

```blade
<form method="POST" action="/contact">
    @csrf
    @protect('contact-form')
    
    <input type="text" name="cf_name" placeholder="Your Name" required>
    <input type="email" name="cf_email" placeholder="Your Email" required>
    <textarea name=cf_"message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
    
    <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

### 2. Apply Middleware

Add the middleware to your routes or controllers:

```php
// In your routes file
Route::post('/contact', [ContactController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware(['anti-scam', 'anti-spam', 'xss']);

// and in your bootstrap/app.php
return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))
    ->withRouting(
        web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',
        commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',
        health: '/up',
    )
    ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
        $middleware->append(\Attargah\AntiScam\Http\Middleware\CheckBlockedIP::class);
    })
    ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {
        //
    })->create();

```
You can also prevent XSS attacks using Validation.
```php
$request->validate([
    'q' => ['required', new Xss],
]);

```
> üí° **Bot Deception / Honeypot Success Message:**  
> To trick scam bots into thinking their request was successful, you can place the following snippet **before saving any data** in your controller:
>
> ```php
> if ($request->input('scam_status_'.config('key'))){
>     return back()->with('success', 'your_message'); // or any success return of your choice
> }
> ```
> This ensures that:
> - Legitimate users are not affected (since they won't trigger the hidden field).  
> - Bots see a success message and believe their request went through.  
> - No actual data is saved for requests flagged as scam.


### 3. Filament Admin Panel

Register the plugin in your Filament panel:

```php
use Attargah\AntiScam\AntiScamPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->plugins([
            AntiScamPlugin::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Middleware Components

### AntiScam Middleware
- Detects scam bots using hidden form fields
- Validates hash-based tokens
- Logs scam attempts and optionally bans IPs

### AntiSpam Middleware
- Implements rate limiting with configurable thresholds
- Progressive ban duration (increases with repeated violations)
- Automatic permanent bans for persistent offenders

### CheckBlockedIP Middleware
- Blocks requests from banned IP addresses
- Supports both temporary and permanent bans
- Returns 403 status for blocked requests

### XSSProtection Middleware
- Sanitizes all input data
- Removes HTML tags and scripts
- Prevents XSS attacks

## Database Tables

The package creates three main tables:

- **`scam_ips`**: Stores detected scam IP addresses and related information
- **`blocked_ips`**: Manages IP blocking with expiration times
- **`blocked_ip_logs`**: Detailed logs of all blocking activities

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
vendor/bin/pest .\vendor\attargah\anti-scam\tests
```

The package includes comprehensive tests for all middleware components and functionality.

## Security Considerations

1. **Secret Key**: Always use a strong, unique secret key for the anti-scam protection
2. **Rate Limiting**: Adjust spam protection settings based on your traffic patterns
3. **IP Blocking**: Be cautious with permanent IP bans as they may affect legitimate users
4. **Logging**: Regularly review logs to identify patterns and adjust protection levels
